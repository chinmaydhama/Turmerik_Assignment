* A positive cough stress test or urodynamic SUI within the past 18 months.
* Normal voiding function as demonstrated by PVR \< 150 mL
* Candidate for either study procedure as determined by treating surgeon (i.e., failed or unable to perform conservative management for SUI including pelvic floor strengthening and failed or declines pessary option for SUI)
* Available for up to 3 years.
* Agrees to randomization.

Exclusion Criteria:

* Anterior/apical vaginal prolapse beyond the hymen (\>0 on POPQ) - Advanced prolapse may require additional surgery or potentially increase the risk of postoperative urinary obstruction and confound the results of the study.
* Urge-predominant mixed UI by UDI-6 despite stable therapy - Urge predominant UI would not be expected to improve after TBA or SIS and may bias results of interventions designed specifically for stress urinary incontinence.
* Planned hysterectomy, urethral or anterior/apical surgeries - additional surgery beyond TBA or SIS has potential to confound the results. Additionally, these procedures generally require general anesthesia and indwelling catheterization immediately post operatively. The impact of urethral instrumentation after TBA is unknown and could impact the efficacy of the urethral coaptation.
* Malignancy or history of radiation of the pelvis - The risk of foreign material rejection and mesh complications may be higher in women with pelvic radiation and other treatment for pelvic malignancy may impact primary outcomes.
* Pregnant, breast feeding or plans for pregnancy within 1 year - subsequent vaginal delivery and hormonal changes of breast feeding prior to primary outcome could impact the efficacy of either treatment.
* Incomplete emptying (PVR \> 150mL) - SUI surgery may increase the risk of urinary retention.
* Prior anti-incontinence procedure - the aim of the study is to identify the role of TBA and SIS in primary, uncomplicated SUI or stress predominant MUI management.
* Neurogenic bladder - the aim of the study is to identify the role of TBA and SIS in primary, uncomplicated SUI or stress predominant MUI management.
* Prior adverse reaction to synthetic mesh or polyacrylamide - to minimize risk of post procedure complications.
* Chronic bladder or pelvic pain conditions (e.g., Interstitial cystitis, painful bladder syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic pelvic pain, etc.) - given the known risks of postoperative pain with SIS and higher risks of pain in those with baseline chronic pain, we aim to minimize post operative complications.
* Active 3rd line treatment for OAB/UUI with botulinum toxin, sacral neuromodulation stimulation (SNS) or percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) within 12 months or plan for 3rd line or new OAB/UUI treatment within 1 year of SUI surgery. For those on stable medication OAB/UUI treatment, participants should be on stable treatment for 3 months with adequate symptom control prior to baseline measures and plan to remain on stable therapy without 3rd line treatment plans within 1 year of SUI surgery. Those who have received 3rd line treatment (Botox. PTNS or SNS) should have a washout of 1yr from and no plans for restarting within the primary outcome timeframe of 1 year post procedure. Those using SNS for bowel leakage only and no UUI symptoms do not require minimum 3 months. Participants with MUI on OAB/UUI medication therapy will still need to have SUI worse than UUI at baseline. Randomization will be stratified based on presence of UUI treatment component.
* Active treatment for SUI with a pessary. For those using a pessary or other SUI support device, a 3-week washout period should occur prior to assessing baseline measures.",RECRUITING
